# Agility for business

[prev](./slide-4.md) / [next](./slide-6.md)

## Business is on our side

In terms of organizational processes, Agile working patterns provide a framework for adapting to change. The Agile community has also developed technical tools and patterns that are helpful when developing software in a frequently changing environment, such as test-driven development (TDD) and refactoring.

- more abstractions to make things simple
- more tests coverage to allow refactoring

## Goal: Simplicity

### Tool: abstractions

Making a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality; it can also mean removing accidental complexity. Moseley and Marks define complexity as accidental if it is not inherent in the problem that the software solves (as seen by the users) but arises only from the implementation. One of the best tools we have for removing accidental complexity is abstraction .

### Our abstractions

For example, high-level programming languages are abstractions that hide machine code, CPU registers, and syscalls. SQL is an abstraction that hides complex on-disk and in-memory data structures.

Just like CPU is abstracted by java language our code should have business related abstractions.
